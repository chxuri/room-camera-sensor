# July 6: LOTS of research on circuits and components!

I went to khanacademy and watched a bunch of videos in their electrical engineering 
section, since I wanted to be fully comfortable with working with different kinds
of circuits, as well as have more information about current direction and voltage. I 
also did research about a lot of the components I'm planning on using, such as cameras, motion sensors, and the microcontroller. I'm thinking of using a raspberry pi 5 but I feel like that might be too expensive so I'll probably do more research on that too. I looked into YOLO since I want to incorporate object detection into my project, so I'll see how that works with other microcontrollers apart from the raspberry pi.

(ps: I don't know how to make links to my progress pictures so I'll be using imgur to add them!)

# July 7: More research on components and began making schematic

I've found majority of the components that I am going to use today! I'm planning on making two parts of my project: the first part will allow a person who knows the pin (me) to enter it into a macropad sort of thing to disable the camera turning on/sending a notification to my phone. I'm planning to use an esp32 for it along with a distance sensor, and maybe an OLED if I have time to display the numbers pressed. This will be a pcb. The other part will be placed on the corner of my room made from a RaspberryPi Zero 2 with a camera module. I'm still trying to figure out how to make the esp32 send a remote signal to the raspi to turn it on/off, but I guess I can always do it with a wire...
