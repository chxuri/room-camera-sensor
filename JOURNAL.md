# July 6: Did LOTS of research on circuits and components I'm planning on using!

I went to khanacademy and watched a bunch of videos in their electrical engineering 
section, since I wanted to be fully comfortable with working with different kinds
of circuits, as well as have more information about current direction and voltage. I 
also did research about a lot of the components I'm planning on using, such as cameras, motion sensors, and the microcontroller. I'm thinking of using a raspberry pi 5 but I feel like that might be too expensive so I'll probably do more research on that too. I looked into YOLO since I want to incorporate object detection into my project, so I'll see how that works with other microcontrollers apart from the raspberry pi.

(ps: I don't know how to make links to my progress pictures so I'll be using imgur to add them!)
